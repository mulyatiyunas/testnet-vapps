*zkdefi – Privacy-Guarded Defi Feeds*

# Category

# Summary
zkDefi is a Web3 microblogging platform built on the Soundness Layer that enables users to share content, comments, and votes while preserving privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.

# Problem
- High Gas Fees → gas fees are sometimes more expensive than the value of small transactions (micropayments).
- Cross-Chain Risk → many bridges have been hacked.
- Liquidity → sometimes it is difficult for merchants to directly convert crypto to fiat.
- Complicated UX → setting chain, gas, token approval makes ordinary users confused.

# Solution
Solutions for DeFi in Payment :
- Secure cross-chain bridge integration allows users to pay from multiple chains without hassle.
- Implementation of transaction batching → several transactions are combined into one for efficiency.
- You can also create a local stablecoin (for example Rupiah stablecoin/IDR token) so that merchants have more confidence.
- Add auto-convert option → merchants accept fiat directly, users still pay using crypto.

# Technical Architecture
- *Frontend*: Next.js + wallet connect (MetaMask, OKX, etc).
- *Backend*: zkApps on Soundness Layer to verify social interactions.
- **Privacy Layer**: zkSNARKs to hide real identity while keeping interactions valid.
- **Storage**: Arweave for decentralized content hosting.

# Timeline
- Week 1–2: Architecture design & zkProof research for reputation.
- Week 3–4: Deploy base contracts.
- Week 5–6: Integrate zkProof & on-chain reputation.
- Week 7: Testnet trial with community participation.
